				<h2>CALL FOR PAPERS</h2>
				<p>AI-enabled AR/VR-based exergames have the potential to enable a broader spectrum of users to participate in rehabilitative and fitness activities in immersive social environments that provide continual feedback to improve performance and incentivize continued usage. However, consumer grade AR/VR systems do not yet have the full capabilities needed to realize exergaming at scale. These challenges include, but are not limited to AI feedback algorithms that can run on untethered systems, long-term usage comfort due to system bulkiness, inability to simulate real-world attributes such as weight and resistance, novel exercise routine generation, and multi-user latency.</p>
				
				<p>We invite academic and industry researchers specializing in AI and/or AR/VR/MR (broadly XR) for exergaming to submit their original work to the 2026 Workshop on AI and AR/VR for Exergaming (AIVR4Exergame). The workshop proceedings and main conference proceedings will be published by IEEE Computer Society Press and submitted for inclusion in the IEEE Xplore Digital Library. Submissions will undergo a thorough peer review by at least two experts in the domain.</p>
				
				<h3>Topics of Interest</h3>
				
                <ul>
						<li>Design of exergames to facilitate long-term continued usage</li>
						<li>Privacy and security and related topics for AI and AR/VR use in exergaming</li>
						<li>Ethical considerations for use of AI for AR/VR-based exergaming</li>
						<li>Design of AI algorithms that provide closed-loop feedback to enable continued usability</li>
						<li>Design of AI algorithms for assessing and correcting virtual interactions for safe usage</li>
						<li>Design of AI algorithms to generate novel exercise routines</li>
						<li>Simulating the real-world in AR/VR (e.g., weight, friction, resistance)</li>
						<li>AI techniques for movement tracking using smartphone sensors for smartphone-based AR/VR exergaming</li>
						<li>Incorporating haptics and biofeedback to ensure safe interactions in immersive AR/VR environments</li>
						<li>Effectiveness of AI-enabled AR/VR-based exergaming through results from case studies</li>
						<li>Emergent hardware platforms to enable broader uptake of AR/VR-based exergames</li>
						<li>Long term physical and psychological effects of exergaming in AR/VR</li>						
						<li>Co-located and remote social environments for AR/VR exergaming</li>
						<li>Designing rehabilitative AR/VR exergames for children, older adults, and individuals with disabilities</li>
						<li>AR/VR-based tele-rehab server platform to connect participants from remote locations</li>
                    </ul>
				
				<h3>Submission Instruction</h3>
				<p>All authors must submit their manuscripts using the IEEE double-column format using the official <a href="https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html" target="_blank">IEEE Manuscript Formatting guidelines</a>. All submissions must be anonymous. Authors must also adhere to the <a href="https://www.ieee.org/publications_standards/publications/rights/index.html" target="_blank">IEEE policies for publications</a>, in other words, you must own the copyright to all parts of the manuscript, the work must be original, and the work cannot be under review somewhere else. Authors that fail to adhere to these policies will have their papers desk rejected. All submissions must be made via EasyChair using the link below (LINK PENDING).</p>
				
				<h3>Page Guidelines</h3>
				<p>All papers must be at most 6-pages in length, excluding references.</p>
				
				<h3>Reviewing process</h3>
				<p>All papers will be reviewed by at least two experts in the domain using a double-blind process. There will be no rebuttal phase for the submissions. Publication in the workshop will not prohibit future publications as full or journal papers with additional material. However, workshop papers cannot be submitted verbatim to another venue with additional material. Authors of accepted papers will be expected to make changes requested during the review and resubmit a final version by the camera-ready deadline.</p>
				
				<h3>Presentation</h3>
				<p>Authors of all accepted papers will present their work at the workshop. Presentations will be 15-minutes long, i.e., approximately 12-minutes for the talk and 3-minutes for Q/A. The workshop is an in-person first event, however, arrangements will be made for authors who cannot travel due to visa or other challenges. Authors requiring visa letters should contact the lead organizer, i.e., Dr. Sean Banerjee, so they can be placed in contact with the main conference organizers.</p>
